Computer Vision and Deep Learning

~~IF score is pitifully low. There must be something wrong, especilly the loss function (whether we need a sigmoid?).~~

~~And how to predict the label with the model output?~~

Data augmentation?

Loss function hyperparameter (change mean to sum)?

Overfitting!

Bugs need to be fixed in trainging process!
